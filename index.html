    <h2 class="w3-wide">WELCOME TO WORLD OF CODE-MIXING</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Aim</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Code-mixing, the alternation of two or more languages within a single utterance or sentence, presents unique challenges and opportunities for linguistic analysis and natural language processing. Our project proposal aims to rectify the aforementioned constraints by the curation and annotation of extensive Hindi-English material that is blended with Indic codes. Additionally, for the benefit of the NLP community interested in code-mixing research, we hope to provide a number of top-notch low-level NLP tagging tools that do named entity recognition, token-level language identification, and POS tagging. In order to successfully train the recent DL architectures with the increasing popularity of DL-based machine translation (MT) systems that generate high-quality translations in many European, English, and Mandarin languages, we aim to create new datasets that are at least 100 times larger than the previous datasets, if any existed at all.We also see a comparable focus on code-mixed translation. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any study that curates large-scale parallel triplets of code-mixed sentences and the accompanying monolingual translations, with the exception of a few recent efforts. We intend to manually translate each code-mixed text to its equivalent English and Hindi language in addition to the token-level language tags. Finally, we seek to create topical and matrix language predictors, since our proposed dataset also includes topic and matrix language (sentence follows the grammatical structure of the matrix language) for each instance. </p>

      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>How work done in different tasks</i></p><br>
      <p class="w3-justify">The field of Natural Language Processing, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, is concerned with providing computers with the ability to comprehend, decipher and create Human Language. Its applications span a wide range of domains, from language translation and sentiment analysis to virtual assistants and chatbots. <br> <br> NLP tasks such as Language Identification (LID), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging are essential for comprehending and analyzing text data in various contexts:<br> <br><b>Language Identification (LID)</b> <br> <br>Language Identification is the process of determining the language of a given piece of text. This is essential for a variety of applications such as Multilingual Content Processing, Language Specific Analysis and Internationalization of Software. With an accurate LID, systems can automatically adapt to the input language of the user, enabling a smoother user experience and more effective communication across diverse linguistic contexts.<br>We can solve the sentence-level Language Identification by identifying the matrix language of the code-mixed text. <br><br> <b>Matrix Language Identification Example:</b><br><br>In our approach to Matrix language identification, we annotate each sentence with the language tag that corresponds to its grammatical structure. For instance:<br><b>Hindi Sentence:</b> "Are cricket se sanyas le liya kya viru aur social service suru"<br>Tagged Matrix Language: Hindi<br><b>English Sentence:</b> "I love playing lukka chuppi with my friends"<br>Tagged Matrix Language: English<br><br><b>Token-level language annotation:</b><br><br>In this annotation scheme, we annotate each token of the sentences to its corresponding language tag. The following example shows a token-level language annotation: <br><br>Sentence: Are&emsp; cricket &emsp;se&emsp; sanyas&emsp; le&emsp; liya &emsp;kya&emsp; viru&emsp; aur &emsp;social&emsp; service&emsp; suru <br>Lang tag:&emsp;&emsp;Hin&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eng&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Hin &emsp;&emsp;Hin&emsp;&emsp; Hin&emsp; Hin &emsp;Hin&emsp; IN&emsp;&emsp; Hin &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eng&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;Eng&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;Hin <br><br>Here, Hin, Eng and IN represent Hindi, English and Language independent tokens, respectively.<br><br><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</b>
<br><br>Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing task that identifies and categorizes named entities within text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. NER is essential to the extraction of information, search engines, question answering systems, social media monitoring and other applications where identifying specific entities is a prerequisite for understanding and analyzing.<br><br>In Named Entity Recognition we perform the token level entity by annotating named entities in the given sentence by using standard English named entities:
<br>i. Person: Modi, Rahul<br>ii. Location: Himalaya, Ganga <br>iii. Organization: Infosys, IIT <br>iv. Date/Time: Today, tomorrow, kal, aaj <br>v. Geopolitical Entities: India, China, US, Bharat <br><br>In addition to the above, we aim to also tag social-media-based specific entities like: <br>I. Hashtags <br>II. Mentions <br>III. Emoji <br>The named entities are language-independent and require special care during the post-processing stages of any code-mixed task. <br><br><b>Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:</b><br><br> Part-of-Speech Tagging is the process of assigning grammatical categories (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to words in a text based on their context and definition. POS tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing, serving as the foundation for many higher-level language understanding tasks. It facilitates tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine translation by allowing machines to understand the syntactic structure of sentences.<br><br>In POS tagging we annotate the given tags. Overall, the plan is to include language-specific POS tags. For example, in a Hinglish sentence, if the token belongs to Hindi, the corresponding Hindi POS tag will be assigned, and if the token belongs to English, the corresponding English POS tag will be assigned. <br></p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">Annotation Framework</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>How work done in Annotation</i></p><br>
      <p class="w3-justify">We intend to create a web-based annotation framework in place of the unconventional spreadsheet-based annotation method. By providing helpful options in the dropdown menu or by presenting the relevant fields based on the previous selection, it will speed up the annotation process and make sentences easier to annotate overall. <br> <br> Commentator is the name of the <b>co</b>de-<b>m</b>ixed <b>m</b>ultilingual t<b>e</b>xt a<b>n</b>no<b>tat</b>ion framew<b>or</b>k we present, specifically built for code-mixed text. In the annotation framework of the proposed system there are primarily two users: i) the annotators and (ii) the admins. The annotators perform the annotation task. Whereas the admins design the annotation task, employ annotators, administer the annotation task, and process the annotations. The admins and the annotators need to signup and login to access the various functionalities of the tool.Given these roles, we describe COMMENTATOR functionalities by introducing the two user panels:<br><br><b>The Annotator Panel:</b> The annotator panel contains two pages:
<br><br><b>1. Annotation page:</b> The below figure illustrates the annotation page. Given a candidate sentence, it allows two levels of annotations. At the first level, the annotator can choose the matrix language of the sentence (see point 1). Out of two supported languages, one can be selected. At the second level, the annotator chooses a language tag for each token of the sentence (see point 2). To make the annotation process faster, we pre-assign each token with a language tag using a state-of-the-art language identification tool. The annotator can update a pre-assigned tag by clicking on the respective tag button. The major annotation instructions are on the left side of the annotator page (see point 3). In below figure, we present a candidate Hinglish sentence to an annotator with username user1. The annotator can select one out of the three possible language tags, Hindi (shown in Yellow color), English (shown in Green color), or language indepen- dent (shown in Blue color). The selection is made by clicking the same tag button sequentially until the desired tag appears. If the annotator incorrectly annotates a sentence, they can update their annotations by clicking on the “Edit Annotations” button (see point 4), which redirects them to the history and edit page.

<br><br><b>2. History and edit page:</b> The below figure showcases history and edit page. It contains a list of sentences annotated in the past along with the timestamp. The annotator can click on any sentence to edit the annotations. A click on a sentence opens the annotation page with previously chosen annotation tags.<img src="1b.png" alt="Me" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="1000" height="650">
<br><br><b>The Admin Panel:</b>The below figure shows the admin panel. The admin panel performs three major tasks:<img src="2.png" alt="Me" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="1000" height="650"><br><br><b>1. Data upload:</b> The administrator can upload the source sentences using a CSV file (see point 1).<br><br><b>
2. Annotation analysis:</b> The administrator can: (i) analyze the quality of annotations using Cohen’s Kappa score for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) (see point 3) and (ii) analyze the degree of code-mixing in the annotated text using the code-mixing index (CMI)(see point 2).<br><br><b>
3. Data download:</b> The admin can download annotations of single/multiple annotators in a CSV
file. The data download functionality also supports the conditional filtering of data based on IAA and CMI.</p>
